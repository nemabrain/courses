# Mechanisms of Memory Course Objectives

- Compare synaptic signaling through ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in the context of learning and memory.
- Outline the steps of a biochemical purification required for finding proteins involved in learning and memory.
- Outline how genetic screeening and genetic dissection in model organisms is used to investigate  learning and memory mechanisms.
- Describe how second messenger signaling cascades contribute to synaptic memory.
- Compare several key differences known to be involved with the storage of nondeclarative and declarative memory.
- Distinguish underlying differences at the molecular and cellular level involved with short and long term learning and memory.
- Describe prevailing models of Alzheimer's disease and pharmacologically strategies being developed to intervene, mitigate, and cure.
